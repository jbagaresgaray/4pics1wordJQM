# 4pics1wordJQM

To run app, there are 2 options

1. By using node as a server, if you have no apache on your workstation.
To begin with,you have to install the LTS node.js at http://www.nodejs.org/. Once installation is done, open terminal and cd to your project

``` bash
		$ cd 4pics1wordJQM/
```
once inside the project folder type: <b> npm install </b>

``` bash
	 $ 4pics1wordJQM :  npm install
```
wait until installation is done. Now once installation is done, type: <b> gulp serve </b>
``` bash
	 $ 4pics1wordJQM : gulp serve
```
to run the project at <b>http://localhost:9003/</b>



2. By using Apache Web Server.
This is the most common hosting on local workstation so I guess no need to elaborate more.

<b> GOOD LUCK </b>
